# GetHome

You're lost and must find your way home before it gets dark! 

This game was written as a part of the [#olcBeatTheBoredom Game Jam on itch.io](https://itch.io/jam/olc-beat-the-boredom)!

Binary releases for [Linux and Windows available on itch.io](https://moros1138.itch.io/get-home).

### Feedback Requested!
I'm not the best programmer and this is the first "game" I've made using C++ that I've been brave enough to publish for the voracious eyes of the internet. With that in mind, any constructive feedback is welcome.

### Building on Windows
This section is incomplete on account that I develop from a Linux first perspective. However, if you use MSYS2 and have the latest version of ``mingw-w64`` as well as ``make`` installed then you can follow the following instructions provided for building on Linux. Pull requests welcome to make this repo more Windows friendly.
